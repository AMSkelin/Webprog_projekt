	<p>Alternative drives and automated driving functions including fully automated driving are opening up new options for the exterior design of vehicles. </p>
	<p>On the one hand they make it possible to create unfamiliar proportions, on the other hand the outer shell of the vehicle takes on new functions – for example to enable intensified communication between the vehicle and its surroundings. With the Vision EQS, Mercedes-Benz is setting a milestone in this respect. </p>
	<p>With its innovative, stretched “One Bow” design, the VISION EQS takes the Progressive Luxury design philosophy of the EQ vehicles into a new dimension. The “seamless” look of this dramatic and powerful sculpture is what gives the Vision EQS its majestic presence.</p>
	<p>Technical features such as the 24-inch multi-spoke wheels, which form a jewel-like counter piece to the flowing body lines, emphasise the luxurious character of the saloon and at the same time convey lightness and sportiness.  
	<p>As do the rear lights, which are for the first time seamlessly integrated into the body: with 229 individual LED stars they show a completely new approach to applying the traditional brand logo.</p>
	<p>The 3D-line structure of the front spoiler in high-gloss black continues across the sides to the rear spoiler. Rosé-gold-coloured blades are nestled in it, conveying luxury and high tech, and underlining the aerodynamic aesthetics of the vehicle. At the same time these systematically horizontal borderlines in the lower section of the vehicle create a suspenseful contrast to the sensuously curved vehicle body.</p>
	<p>However, the design goes another step further. Thanks to the seamless integration of the lights, the VISION EQS becomes a communicative vehicle, a “cooperative car”. 
	<p>The 360° exterior lightbelt, the digital LED matrix grille and the DIGITAL LIGHT headlamps allow interaction between the vehicle and its surroundings.</p>
